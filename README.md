## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React.js, Express.js, Node.js, Strip Payment API.

This is an app for a jewelry store called Fashion Bros. This app features an online shopping cart that links to Stripe for payment. This app was built using React for the front end and Express.js for the backend routing. 

## Lessons Learned:

Some lessons I learned were: 
I wasn't familiar with the Stripe API before this project. I learned about 'test-mode' and how to set that up for payments. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
